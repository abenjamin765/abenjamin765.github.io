	<h2>My Role</h2>
	<p>I led the re-design of the att.com search filters across the Web, iOS, and Android from the beginning of the project in July 2014 to when it went live in August 2015.</p>
	<p>Until the launch, I led efforts to fine-tune the interface based on performance and customer feedback.</p>

	<h3>Research &amp; Customer Insights</h3>
	<p>I partnered with the the human factors team to review and test the existing experience. This uncovered customer pain-points, motivations, and other insights that were used to develop features and outline project goals.</p>

	<h3>Solution Visualization</h3>
	<p>I created low-fidelity prototypes to illustrate core concepts and ideas to stakeholders and leadership. Socializing ideas visually helped align decision makers and facilitated productive discussion.</p>

	<h3>Definition and Strategy</h3>
	<p>I worked with my business analyst and project manager to define the product. I documented and socialized customer goals with stakeholders in order to map them to related business goals. I prioritized features and helped organize release plans with technical managers.</p>

	<h3>Design Execution</h3>
	<p>I outlined customer journeys, sketched out wire frames, and created high-fidelity mock-ups with design specs. I designed each feature across the Web, iOS, and Android.</p>

	<h3>Validation</h3>
	<p>I partnered with the human factors team to re-test and validate the proposed design solution. </p>

	<h3>Leadership</h3>
	<p>I designed and presented visuals to get buy-in from stakeholders, partner teams, design leadership, and executives throughout the creative process.</p>

	<p class="eyebrow">The Challenge</p>
	<h2>Improve Search Success on att.com</h2>	
	<p>Multiple data-sources showed lower than expected success rates for the top 50 terms searched for on att.com. Observing site data and customer testing revealed that this was likely due to cross-product results, and popular terms that were broad subjects like "billing" or "phone." </p>
	<p>Our challenge was to investigate opportunities to remove obstacles from the online search experience and provide better control of the results.</p>

	<p class="eyebrow">The Goal</p>
	<h2>Make it obvious</h2>
	<p>Looking at proven trends, testing results, and recommendations from partner teams, I defined design principles that would drive the rest of the creative process:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>UI labels will be direct and descriptive</li>
		<li>Search result controls will be obvious</li>
		<li>Instructional text will be minimal</li>
		<li>Narrowing content will be a progressive task</li>
		<li>No options should be hidden</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The main goal of the new design is to remove the "clutter" of arrows, instructions, help icons, and other cues in favor of more obvious interactions.</p>

	<h3>Defining Success</h3>
	<p>I worked with the leadership team and stakeholders to define how we wanted to measure the success of the redesigned page. We were able to identify key areas we thought we could improve: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Decrease bounce rate</li>
		<li>Decrease rate of appended queries</li>
		<li>Increase search result clicks</li>
		<li>Increase filter engagement</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="eyebrow">Discovery</p>
	<h2>Watch and learn</h2>
	<p>Something I noticed was consistent in both user testing and our site data was the seldom use of filters when a user performed a search. The data showed a large number of query resubmissions, both with the same keyword and some with new keywords. Very few sessions showed use of even top-level filters.</p>
	
	<p>This highlighted an opportunity to learn how this component impacts the experience and to help it evolve with the needs of our customers.</p>

	<h3>Testing...Is this thing on?</h3>
	<p>I helped organize tasks to stress-test the existing search filters alongside a challenger version to see which needles would move.</p>
	<p>I noted that a number of the participants expressed that having a filter option would be a high-value feature. However, the same participants didn't use the filters available in the existing design. When performing the same task in the new design, we saw a lift in both the use of filters and task completion.</p>
	<p>This suggested that the visual appearance and layout of the filter component had a large impact on how often it was used and the success of finding accurate search results.</p>

	<h2>Find the Needle in a Haystack</h2>
	<p>The job of the local search engine is to find content within the website that might be helpful to the user. The user gives provides keywords and chooses filters to help narrow results and find what they're looking for.</p>
	<h3>Framework</h3>
	<p>I wire-framed iterations based on 3 frameworks that fit the user goals and design principles. Exploring unique frameworks brought to light new challenges, and also new ideas.</p>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The accordion framework puts fewer options on the page at once, but hides important items</li>
		<li>The radio-list framework makes all options visible, and offers a familiar control</li>
		<li>Revealing new options as the user makes selections helps the user narrow their results and keep the context</li>
		<li>There always has to be a selected radio button in a group</li>
		<li>If a filter yields no results, should it be an option?</li>
	</ul>

<article class="snippet">
	<h3>Taxonomy</h3>
	<p>I used the results from a card-sort where customers were asked to sort products, tasks, and services into logical categories to inform how the filters were grouped and how a user might navigate from one set of filters to the next.</p>
