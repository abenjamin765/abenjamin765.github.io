				<h2>Concept - Buzz Messenger</h2>
				<p class="hero">Amazon Buzz is designed to give Amazon employees a way to communicate thatâ€™s secure, fast, and integrated with tools they use day-to-day. Buzz allows users to have 1-on-1 conversations, create meetings, share files, give feedback, and track projects.</p>

				<h3><span>My role</span></h3>
				<p>I designed the Buzz concept as part of a pitch to the team responsible for maintaining the tools Amazon employees use. I used email surveys, in-person interviews, and an analysis of the current tool-set available to employees to shape the design and feature-set of Buzz.</p>

				<h3><span>Objective</span></h3>
				<p>Buzz will combine common tasks that Amazon employees usually use multiple tools to achieve. Buzz offers a more streamlined way to communicate across the company thatâ€™s easy to use and familiar.</p>

				<h2>Dummi.io</h2>
				<p class="hero"><a href="http://www.dummi.io" target="_blank">Dummi</a> offers designers and developers an approachable way to generate randomized data for their projects. Dummi was designed to remove the barrier of relying on coding skills to call data from an API and to make the data output portable and consumable by design tools, prototypes, or testing environments.</p>

				<h3><span>My role</span></h3>
				<p>I designed and built Dummi for my own use. I needed a way to create static JSON files to populate my FramerJS prototypes with data without relying on dynamic data from an external source or setting up my own data source. When I put Dummi online, feedback began rolling in on Twitter for new features and updates. I still maintain and improve Dummi today with the help of 2 awesome volunteers.</p>

				<h3><span>Objective</span></h3>
				<p>A designer can use Dummi to generate data they need to create a real-world mockup or prototype. Using real data instead of placeholders allows designers to design in context.</p>

				<h2>Applause</h2>
				<p class="hero">Today, restaurant waiters are left shortchanged because of dated gratuity practices that make the dining experience awkward for both the customer and the waiter.</p>

				<h3><span>My role</span></h3>
				<p>I developed a product to change the way we end a meal when dining out. I surveyed and interviewed a group of 17 people who work as servers in a restaurant to better understand how they get feedback from customer and the friction they experience with modern tipping practices. I designed and prototyped Applause and am currently learning Java to begin developing it for Android.</p>

				<h3><span>Objective</span></h3>
				<p>By re-framing the process, Applause aims to modernize the dining experience to better suit the way we think about gratuities. Applause will also provide waiters with a mechanism to measure their performance, collect feedback, and advance their careers.</p>
