				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>About 65% of pet owners acquire their pets free or at low cost.</li>
						<li>The majority of pets are obtained from acquaintances and family members. 15 - 20% of dogs are purchased from breeders, 10 - 20% of cats and dogs are adopted from shelters and rescues, and 2 - 10% are purchased from pet shops.</li>

				<dt>What reasons do people surrender animals?</dt>
				<dd>According to the American Humane Association, the most common reasons why people relinquish or give away their dogs is because their place of residence does not allow pets (29%), not enough time, divorce/death and behavior issues (10% each). The most common reasons for cats are that they were not allowed in the residence (21%) and allergies (11%).</dd>

			<h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> User Definition</h3>
			<p>This product is being designed for use by individuals or families in need of a pet.</p>
			
			<h3><i class="fa fa-commenting-o"></i> Problem Statement</h3>
			<p>The most common reasons pets find their way into shelters are misinformation and misaligned expectations. Methods of finding a pet both online and offline rely on the pet-seeker's personal taste and knowledge about the animals they're looking for. There isn't currently an effective way to facilitate a two-way match between animal and household.</p>
			
			<h3><i class="fa fa-flag-checkered"></i> Goals</h3>
			<p>It's important to set goals for a solution. This helps to drive the ongoing conversation about what the end-product is setting out to achieve and sets the parameters of what is being designed.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Personalize choices</li>
				<li>Facilitate longer lasting pet relationships</li>
				<li>Minimize misinformation and confusion</li>
				<li>Set expectations for pet-seekers</li>
				<li>Minimize the risk of shelter returns</li>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>Design an experience that will help connect people looking for a new pet with the right companion for them.</p>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-map-signs"></i> Journey Mapping</h3>
			<p>Journey mapping is a tool to help what customers truly want â€“ the real moment's of truth and the ways in which customers go about achieving their needs.</p>
			<a class="citation" href="http://www.walkerinfo.com/docs/Walker-Customer-Journey-Mapping.pdf">http://www.walkerinfo.com/docs/Walker-Customer-Journey-Mapping.pdf</a>
			<img src="/img/journey-map.jpg" alt="Journey Map">
			
			<h3><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> Design Principles</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Menus should be obvious</li>
				<li>Every decision point should be intentional</li>
				<li>Visuals should be bright an energetic</li>
				<li>Physical metaphors should be use to help guide interactions</li>
				<li>On-screen instruction to the user should be minimal</li>
				<li>Controls come secondary to content</li>
				<li>Design needs to be thumb friendly</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><i class="fa fa-flask"></i> Features</h3>
			<p>Selecting an MVP feature set keeps the initial design focused on achieving the set goals and ultimately pushes the product to market faster. This will also set a solid foundation for new features as the product scales.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Human and animal profile creation</li>
				<li>Pet information validation</li>
				<li>Human-to-animal matching</li>
				<li>Online pet listing crawler</li>
				<li>Communication between pet-seeker and shelter</li>
				<li>Choosing process</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="/img/flow.jpg" alt="Product Features">

			<h3><i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> Wireframe</h3>
			<p>Wireframing the features into screen layouts and sewing them into flows provides the foundation for the visual and interaction design of the product.</p>
			<h4>Lo-fi Sketches</h4>
			<p>Sketching on a white-board or with pen and paper allows me to get ideas into visuals quickly without committing to a particular concept immediately.</p>
			<img src="/img/wires.jpg" alt="Profile Wireframe">
			<h4>Hi-fi Wireframes</h4>
			<p>Notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Collected profile information will be used to recommend animals based on geography, income, personality type, and other factors that usually result in re-homed animals.</li>
				<li>Information will be stored for future learning about what animals users prefer based on their selections in voting in correlation with their user profile information.</li>
				<li>The language used should be informal and conversational.</li>
				<li>The interactions should feel like a dialog between the user and the interface.</li>
				<li>The top 16 matches will be displayed. The user will be required to vote for each one before progressing so that each animal receives consideration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="note done"><strong>TO DO:</strong> I need to revisit the questions being asked after more research on what factors might affect the relationship with the adopted animal.</p>
			<img src="/img/wire-hifi1.jpg" alt="Wireframe">
			<p>Notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Research shows that pet-seekers choose pets based on breed, appearance, state of health, age, and gender.</li>
				<li>While other factors are important to the owner-pet relationship, these attributes aren't displayed. However, these traits do determine the options shown to the user so that they're picking out of a pool of the best matches.</li>
				<li>Viewing options one-by-one reduces decision fatigue and makes for a more thorough deduction vs. comparative deduction.</li>
				<li>If no results are returned, the user has an option to set a notification to return at a later date.</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="/img/wire-hifi2.jpg" alt="Wireframe">
			<p>Notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A score based on how well the profiles of the pet-seeker and the animal shown match on each card might help the user make a better choice.</li>
				<li>Users will review their final choices before making an adoption decision. This allows the user to essentially pick the same animal a second time from a smaller pool. This demonstrates more confidence in the decision being made.</li>

			<h3><i class="fa fa-paint-brush"></i> Visual Design</h3>
			<p>Now that I have design principles defined and my screens sketched out, I need to express those designs visually in a way that's familiar to the user on each of the target platforms.</p>
			<h4>Android</h4><span class="citation"> (Complete)</span>
			<p>For Android, I chose to use Google's Material Design guidelines as a starting point. First, I need to think about what the app is made of and how it feels.</p>

			<img src="/img/design-study.jpg" alt="Design Study">
			<p class="note done"><strong>TO-DO:</strong> After doing a design study for the voting screen, I noticed that there's some opportunity to better apply some of the design principles defined earlier in the process. I'll make note of these adjustments as I iterate on these and other screens.</p>
			<img src="/img/android_vote-final.jpg" alt="">
			<ul>
				<li>Moved the controls to the bottom to be more "thumb friendly" on larger devices.</li> 
				<li>Added main menu button to the bottom</li>
				<li>Dialed back the UI colors in order to emphasis the main content</li>
				<li>Removed the "both" option in favor of a more intentional decision on animal type.</li>
			</ul>

			<img src="/img/questionnaire.jpg" alt="">
			<img src="/img/mocks.jpg" alt="">

			<h3><i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> Interaction Design</h3>
			<p>In the IXD part of the process, I revisit my design principles and project goals to inform how the user moves around the app, how the each element behaves, and how each interaction makes an emotional connection with the user.</p>
			<h4>Menu animation</h4>
			<div class="gif"><img src="/img/menu-animation.gif" alt=""></div>
			<h4>Vote animation</h4>

			<h3><i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> User Testing</h3>
			<p>Testing went well. Even the youngest participant was able to identify and select a furry friend.</p>

			<h2>Success</h2>
			<p>Help an adopter find a pet that matches his or her lifestyle, considering factors including breed, gender, age, temperament, and health status.</p>
			<h3>Goal check</h3>
			<p>To define success, the product needs to achieve the goals set at the beginning of the process. Measurements and observations before and after the launch of the finished product highlight how successful it is.</p>
			<h4>Measurements</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Pet relationship longevity - This can be measured as part of the in-app experience or with a follow-up survey.</li>
				<li>Animal repeat entries - Animals who reappear in the database as "for adoption" are likely returned to the shelter.</li>
				<li>Number of adoptions - The animals adopted using the app now have a home.</li>	
				<li>Adoption to Surrender ratio - This ratio highlights the impact of more informed adoption decisions</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Observations</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The animal adoption process</li>
				<li>How people make choices about which animal to adopt</li>
				<li>The tools people use to find animals for adoption</li>
				<li>Attributes that impact adoption choices</li>
