	<h2>Project Summary</h2>	
	<p>User feedback from the App Store and input from stakeholders pointed to a visual refresh of the existing product.</p>
	<p>The app is used to scan and reveal user-generated AR content created in-app or in the advanced web editor.</p>
	<p>My goal was to bring the visuals inline with modern design patterns and styles that would be familiar to our users.</p>
